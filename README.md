# Prompt Engineering Strategies

This repository houses the source code and materials for the research paper titled "Revisiting Prompt Engineering: Strategic Interactions with Large Language Models for Application Development". The paper discusses various strategies for optimizing the interactions with large language models (LLMs) using deliberate and methodical prompt engineering techniques.

## Overview

The research paper addresses the following core topics:

- **Strategic Prompt Design**: Examination of how structured and thoughtfully designed prompts can significantly enhance the output quality of LLMs.
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed analysis of different metrics such as BLEU Score, ROUGE Score, and BERTscore, used to evaluate the effectiveness of various prompt engineering strategies.
- **Interactive Examples**: Inclusion of interactive Quarto/Jupyter Notebook examples that allow readers to see the impact of different prompt strategies in real-time.
- **Case Studies**: Application of prompt engineering strategies in real-world scenarios to demonstrate their practical implications and benefits.
- **Future Directions**: Exploration of potential future research areas in prompt engineering and strategic interactions with LLMs.
